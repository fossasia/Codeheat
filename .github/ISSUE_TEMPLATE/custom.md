### OBJECTIVE
An initial sentence or two that describes what the task entails and why someone would want to spend their time on it. 

### REQUIREMENTS
Several sentences/bullets that provide more detail into the task: What approach should people use? What level of detail are you looking for? How people should submit their work? Please keep CodeHeat registration as the first requirement. 
- Register as a CodeHeat participant if you haven't already done so https://codeheat.org/register

### EXPECTED OUTCOME
What the expected deliverable is (a tutorial reviewed by at least one member of the documentation team and posted to the handbook, a patch in the core issue queue marked ready to be committed...). Please be specific as possible here. If people should create a patch, specify the branch against which the patch should be rolled. If a handbook page should be created, it's great to specify what you think the parent should be.
